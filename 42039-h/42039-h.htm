<h3>JOHN GOODWIN'S SIX BOOKSELLERS' PROCTOR NONSUITED.</h3>

  <p>The London booksellers of the present day (good harmless men!) are
  satisfied with endeavouring to put down heresies as to discounts. Their
  predecessors, in the year 1655, set to work in good earnest, associated
  to purify the faith by denouncing in an Index expurgatorius, under the
  alarming titles of <i>A Beacon set on Fire</i>, and <i>A Second Beacon
  set on Fire</i>, all publications of a blasphemous, heretical, or
  improper kind. Six booksellers, viz. Luke Fawne, Samuel Gellibrand,
  Joshua Kirton, John Rothwell, Thomas Underhill, and Nathaniel Webb, took
  the lead on the occasion; and the battle waxed hot and fierce between
  them and the apologists of the books condemned. Amongst the latter was
  the famous John Goodwin, whose part in the controversy Mr. Jackson, in
  his elaborate Life of him, has adverted to, and has noticed his pamphlet
  entitled <i>The High Presbyterian Spirit</i>, written in answer to the
  <i>Second Beacon Fired</i>. John Goodwin, however, published a second
  pamphlet in the same controversy, neither noticed by Mr. Jackson, nor any
  one else that I am aware of, in which he finishes up his first charge
  upon the unfortunate booksellers, and lays on them with a vigour and
  determination that it does one good to see so well bestowed, scattering
  their arguments and quotations to the winds, and sending them back to
  their proper occupation of printing and publishing, instead of clipping
  and suppressing. The title of this very rare pamphlet, which is to be
  found in vol. xviii. of a collection of tracts (between 1640 and 1660) in
  ninety-six vols. 4to., made by President Bradshaw, and containing many of
  his MS. notes and observations now in my possession, is as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Six Booksellers' Proctor Nonsuited, wherein the gross Falsifications
  and Untruths, together with the inconsiderate and weak Passages found in
  the Apologie for the said Booksellers, are briefly noted and evicted. And
  the said Booksellers proved so unworthy both in their Second Beacon
  Fired, and likewise in their Epistle written in Defence of it, that they
  are out of the Protection of any Christian or reasonable Apologie for
  either. By J. G., a Minister of the Gospel of <!-- Page 554 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="026.png"><a name="page554"></a>{554}</span>Jesus
  Christ. London printed for H. Cripps and L. Lloyd, 1655, 4to., pages
  23."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I might give an extract or two from this very interesting tract, but
  do not wish to trespass too much upon your space. Perhaps, next to
  Milton, there is no writer of the time of the Commonwealth equal to John
  Goodwin, in power and elevation of composition; and I am glad therefore
  to be able to add one more to the series of his pamphlets which his
  biographer has with so much industry and research enumerated at the close
  of the Life.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Jas. Crossley.</span></p>

<h3>MR. COLLIER'S FOLIO SHAKSPEARE: A PASSAGE IN "AS YOU LIKE IT."</h3>

  <p>It appears to me so obvious that the degree of authority to be
  conceded to each particular correction or emendation in Mr. Collier's
  folio Shakspeare must depend in a great measure on the general character
  of the proposed alterations throughout the work, that I cannot help
  thinking it would be desirable to reserve all controversy on such points
  until after the appearance of the promised volume. Such a resolution I
  made for myself, and to it I shall religiously adhere. This much only I
  shall say, that, of the specimens given by Mr. Collier in the
  <i>Athenæum</i>,&mdash;sufficient at once to excite interest and to
  gratify curiosity,&mdash;some of the corrections appear to be of that
  nature that no conjecture could have supplied, while all are good enough
  to command a deferential consideration.</p>

  <p>Your correspondent A. E. B. has attempted a defence of the original
  reading of two passages amended in Mr. Collier's folio. For the reason
  above given I shall neither answer your correspondent, nor even say
  whether I think him right or wrong; but it will not be overstepping the
  bounds I have prescribed myself, if I take up a collateral point he has
  raised in reference to one of these passages. To strengthen the case for
  the reading of the passage in <i>Cymbeline</i>, Act III. Sc. 4., "Whose
  mother was her painting," he cites a passage from <i>As You Like It</i>,
  Act III. Sc. 5., in which he says, "<i>mother</i> is directly used as a
  sort of warranty of female beauty!" Here is the passage:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i6hg3">"Who might be your mother,</p>
      <p>That you insult, exult, and all at once,</p>
      <p>Over the wretched?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Shakspeare was, if I am not mistaken, one of those persons to whom a
  <i>mother</i> was, as some one expresses it, "the holiest thing alive."
  He concentrates this sentiment in the words of Troilus (<i>Troilus and
  Cressida</i>, Act V. Sc. 2.):</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Let it not be believ'd for womanhood:</p>
      <p>Think we had mothers."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And again, in those of Palamon (which I have no doubt are
  Shakspeare's) in the <i>Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, Act V. Sc. 1.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8hg3">"I have been harsh</p>
      <p>To large confessors, and have hotly ask'd them</p>
      <p>If they had mothers? I had one, a woman,</p>
      <p>And women t'were they wrong'd."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Now it seems to me that the same feeling is implied in Rosalind's
  reproof to Phebe; and that there is no ground whatever for saying that
  <i>mother</i> is used as a warranty for <i>female beauty</i>, but rather
  as one for feminine qualities. Rosalind in effect says, "who might your
  mother be that you should be so unfeeling?" And, as she tells her plainly
  she sees no beauty in her, it is clearly to be inferred that it must have
  been for some other quality that her mother was to be "warranty."
  Rosalind, in other words, might have said, "Had you a mother, a woman,
  that you can so discredit the character of womanhood as to exult, insult
  and all at once, over the wretched?"</p>

  <p>It might however be contended, that Rosalind's question referred to
  the rank, condition, or personal appearance of the mother. The latter
  only bears upon this question; and with regard to that it may be said,
  that if beauty had been transmitted to the daughter (independently of the
  questioner having decided <i>that</i> it had not), the question was not
  needed. Rosalind, in short, seeks for a better cause for Phebe's pride or
  want of feeling than her own insufficient attractions, in the nature or
  quality of her mother. It will be observed that, in this view, I have
  conceded that <i>who</i> may be taken with something of the signification
  of <i>what</i>; but the answer to the question, taken strictly, must be
  the name of some individual who might be known to the Querist, and be in
  some measure a warranty for the disposition of the daughter, though for
  no personal beauty but her own.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, NO. III.&mdash;LAURENCE HUMPHREY, PRESIDENT OF MAGDALEN COLLEGE, OXFORD, <br />
AND DEAN OF WINCHESTER.</h3>

  <p>In the year 1558 a handsome volume was printed at Basle, in folio in
  Greek, by Jerome Frobenius and Nicholas Episcopius, with the following
  title:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span title="KERAS AMALTHEIAS, Ê ÔKEANOS. TÔN EXÊGÊSEÔN ÔMÊRIKÔN, ek tôn tou Eustatheiou parekbolôn sunêrmosmenôn" class="grk"
  >&Kappa;&Epsilon;&Rho;&Alpha;&Sigma;
  &Alpha;&Mu;&Alpha;&Lambda;&Theta;&Epsilon;&Iota;&Alpha;&Sigma;, &Eta;
  &Omega;&Kappa;&Epsilon;&Alpha;&Nu;&Omicron;&Sigma;. &Tau;&Omega;&Nu;
  &Epsilon;&Xi;&Eta;&Gamma;&Eta;&Sigma;&Epsilon;&Omega;&Nu;
  &Omega;&Mu;&Eta;&Rho;&Iota;&Kappa;&Omega;&Nu;, &#x1F10;&kappa;
  &tau;&omega;&nu; &tau;&omicron;&upsilon;
  &#x1F18;&upsilon;&sigma;&tau;&alpha;&theta;&epsilon;&#x1F77;&omicron;&upsilon;
  &pi;&alpha;&rho;&epsilon;&kappa;&beta;&omicron;&lambda;&#x1F7C;&nu;
  &sigma;&upsilon;&nu;&eta;&rho;&mu;&omicron;&sigma;&mu;&#x1F73;&nu;&omega;&nu;</span>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
  Copiæ Cornu sive Oceanus Enarrationum Homericarum, ex Eustathii in eundem
  commentariis concinnatarum, Hadriano Junio autore."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>To an Oxford man, independent of its merit as a compendium of the
  prolix comment of Eustathius, this volume should be especially
  interesting, on account of the prefatory dissertation "Ad <!-- Page 555
  --><span class="pagenum" title="027.png"><a
  name="page555"></a>{555}</span>Magdalinenses," entitled <i>De Græcis
  Literis et Homeri Lectione et Imitatione</i>, by Laurence Humphrey. This
  worthy was sometime Greek reader in the university, but went abroad on
  account of religion at the accession of Queen Mary, and did not return
  until happier times after her death. He seems to have been living at
  Basle with Frobenius and Episcopius <i>in honestissimo loco</i>, but he
  could not avoid often thinking of his native land,&mdash;of
  Newport-Pagnell in Bucks, where he was born,&mdash;of Cambridge, where he
  received the rudiments of Latin and Greek,&mdash;but more especially of
  Oxford, where he completed his education. His feeling panegyric of his
  Alma Mater, shows him to have been at least one of her grateful sons. The
  dissertation is highly creditable to him, considering the period at which
  it was written; and the passage in which he gives an account of the work
  is not devoid of interest.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"For the rest we give not Homer alone, but the Expositor Eustathius is
  subjoined. Yet not entire but reduced into a compendium by a man of
  untiring labour and noble learning&mdash;Hadrian Junius, not unknown to
  you,&mdash;for he lived some time in England, dedicated his Greek Lexicon
  to our royal Edward the Sixth, and has since published the <i>Annals of
  Queen Mary</i>, his <i>Animadversiones</i>, and <i>Centuries
  Adagiorum</i>, which issued from the press of Frobenius: he also effected
  this good work. Therefore although I had rather have the whole of
  Eustathius than the half, and to say the truth Epitomies never pleased
  me, yet because this author is prolix, and difficult to meet with, this
  perfect compendium of such an estimable work (which seems to me to be the
  best interpreter, poetical-elucidator, Greek lexicon, and onomasticon),
  will be useful to any one. I recommend, then, our Eustathio-Junian Homer
  to you."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In 1560 Laurence Humphrey seems to have been still at Basle; for in
  that year he printed at the press of Oporinus, in 12mo., a work which he
  dedicates to Queen Elizabeth, entitled <i>Optimates, sive de Nobilitate,
  ejusque Antiqua Origine, Natura, Officiis, disciplina, et recta
  Christiana Institutione</i>; at the end of which he printed the argument
  of Philo-Judæus, <span title="peri eugeneias" class="grk"
  >&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#x1F76;
  &epsilon;&upsilon;&gamma;&epsilon;&nu;&epsilon;&#x1F77;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span>,
  with a Latin version. This found favour in the eyes of an English
  translator, and it was printed at London by Thomas Marshe in 1563, 16mo.,
  under the following title:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Nobles, or of Nobilitye. The original, duties, ryght, and
  Christian Institucion thereof, in three Bookes. Fyrste eloquentlye
  written in Latine by Laurence Humphrey, D. of Divinity and Presidente of
  Magdaleine College in Oxforde, lately Englished. Whereto, for the
  reader's commoditye and matters affinitye, is coupled the small treatyse
  of Philo a Jewe. By the same Author out of Greek Latined, now also
  Englished."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Antony à Wood gives a list of the writings of Laurence Humphrey, among
  which is a life of Bishop Jewell in Latin: he also speaks highly of his
  scholarship and proficiency in theology. After his return from abroad he
  became Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford, and President of his
  college. In 1570 he was made Dean of Gloucester, and ten years afterward
  Dean of Winchester. His divinity was strongly tinctured with Calvinism,
  but he was a zealous and able defender of the Reformation. His death
  occurred in 1589-90.</p>

<h3>SCOTO-GALLICISMS.</h3>

  <p>The following list of Scottish words derived from the French language
  is chiefly taken from the pages of the <i>Scottish Journal</i>, a small
  weekly periodical, published at Edinburgh, which came to a conclusion,
  after rather less than a year's existence, in the summer of 1848. It is
  generally supposed that most of these words were introduced during the
  time of Queen Mary's minority, when French troops were sent to Scotland;
  but the first appearance of some of them may unquestionably be referred
  to an earlier period. Perhaps some of the readers of "N. &amp; Q." may be
  able to communicate other examples, which, however, as a reference to
  Jamieson's <i>Scottish Dictionary</i> will show, are by no means very

<h3>ON A PASSAGE IN "CYMBELINE," ACT IV. SC. 2.</h3>

  <p>It is so usual with Malone and some other commentators on Shakspeare
  to impute the errors of the printer to the poet, that we often find the
  most glaring instances of false grammar, and anomalies of construction,
  laid to his charge, and defended as the practice of the time; and as his
  own practice!</p>

  <p>The following passage is an instance in point:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>Gui.</i>              Why, he but sleeps;</p>
      <p>If he be gone, he'll make his grave a bed;</p>
      <p>With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,</p>
      <p>And worms will not come to thee."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Steevens with reason says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This change from the second person to the third is so violent, that I
  cannot help imputing it to the players, transcribers, or printers."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>He proposed to read <i>him</i> for <i>thee</i>. Malone of course
  defends the absurdity. We may, however, be assured that it is not
  attributable to the poet. Whoever reads the passage with attention will
  perceive that the allusion in the last line is not to Fidele, but to the
  fairies haunting his tomb. It should be remembered that it was held that
  no noxious creatures would be found where fairies resort.</p>

  <p>The compositor, as in other cases, mistook the word, probably written
  "th&#x113;," and printed "thee" for "them."</p>

  <p>Your correspondent <span class="sc">Mr. Halliwell</span> having
  noticed my approval of the emendation of a passage in <i>Coriolanus</i>,
  found in <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span>'s copy of the second folio,
  where "bosom multiplied" is happily corrected to "bissom multitude,"
  perhaps I may be permitted to say that I cannot subscribe to his opinion,
  that "it is one of those alterations which no conjectural ingenuity could
  have suggested." To me it appears that the steps are obvious by which any
  intelligent reader of the poet might be led to make the correction. The
  word which was mistaken by the printer for "bosome" occurs in a previous
  scene of the play, where it is "beesome" in the folios; and a
  recollection of this would naturally lead to the conjectured emendation.
  Indeed the word appears to have been not unfrequently written "beasom,"
  as we find it in Huloet's <i>Dictionary</i>. The word "multitude" would
  suggest itself to any attentive reader of the play, from its repeated
  occurrence in the 3rd Scene of Act II.: and we must always suppose the
  writer to have been intent upon correcting errata. The correction of
  "infuite comming" to "infinite cunning," in <i>Measure for Measure</i>,
  is, in my mind, an instance quite equal in "conjectural ingenuity;" and
  we know that we owe it to that of the late Mr. Sidney Walker.</p>

  <p>I must candidly confess that the specimens of the corrections given by
  <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> in his first two communications to
  the <i>Athenæum</i> gave me the same dissatisfaction and apprehension
  that <span class="sc">Mr. Halliwell</span> appears to have entertained;
  but I do not draw the same inference that gentleman seems to do, from the
  occurrence of this one truly happy conjectural emendation. It is,
  however, sufficient to convey a favourable notion of the acuteness of the
  writer of the emendatory notes, and nothing more.</p>

<h3>OLD CONCERT BILL.</h3>

  <p>The following curious bill (the original of which is in my possession)
  of a benefit concert given by Signor Carbonelli, at Drury Lane Theatre,
  in 1722, will enable us to form some opinion of the musical taste
  prevailing in London in the first quarter of the eighteenth century:</p>

<p class="ac">
"<span class="sc">Drury Lane Theatre.</span><br />
<i>May 4.</i><br />
SIGNOR CARBONELLI'S CONCERT.<br />

<i>A New Concerto</i> for Two Trumpets, composed and<br />
performed by Grano and others.<br />
<i>A New Concerto</i>, by Albinoni, just brought over.<br />
<i>Song</i>, Mrs. Barbier.<br />
<i>Concerto</i>, composed by Signor Carbonelli.<br />
<!-- Page 557 --><span class="pagenum" title="029.png"><a name="page557"></a>{557}</span>
<br />
<span class="sc">Act II.</span><br />
<i>A Concerto</i>, with Two Hautbois and Two Flutes,<br />
composed by Dieupart.<br />
<i>A Concerto</i> on the Base Violin, by Pippo.<br />
<i>Song</i>, Mrs. Barbier.<br />
By desire, the <i>Eighth Concerto</i> of Arcangelo Corelli.<br />
<br />

Woodcock, and performed by Baston.<br />
<i>Solo</i>, Signor Carbonelli.<br />
<i>Finale.</i> <i>Concerto</i> on Two Trumpets, by Grano and<br />
others."
</p>

  <p>I should mention, that Signor Carbonelli was a celebrated violin
  player, and a favourite pupil of Corelli. He was brought over to this
  country by his patron, the first Duke of Rutland.</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Note for Mr. Worsaae.</i>&mdash;At page 204. of <i>The Danes in
  England</i>, Mr. W. says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Towards Glasgow and Edinburgh the mountains are no longer called
  'fell' and 'rigg.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The <i>Campsie Fells</i>, a fine range of hills within nine miles of
  Glasgow, are an exception. These hills are never spoken of by the natives
  of the strath except by the name of "fells" and the singularity of the
  name has often been remarked to the writer of this note, especially by
  visitors to the valley. Before being much acquainted with the deeds of
  the Vikings (except in the <i>general</i>), he had come to the conclusion
  that the name <i>must</i> be Danish, from its similarity to "Fjeld," with
  which, in connexion with "Fiords," he had become familiar at a very early
  period.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Bruno.</span></p>

  <p><i>Singular Epitaph.</i>&mdash;The following epitaph occurs in
  Braunston churchyard, Northamptonshire:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"To the Memory of <span class="sc">William Borrows</span>, Died
  1703.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"'Tis true I led a single life,</p>
      <p>And Nare was married in my life,</p>
      <p>For of that Seck (<i>sic</i>) I nare had none:</p>
      <p>It is the Lord; his will be done."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Cranmore.</span></p>

  <p><i>Largesse.</i>&mdash;I heard this old word used the other day in
  Northamptonshire, by a servant who was leaving his employer, and who
  called upon one of his master's tradesmen to ask him for <i>largisse</i>,
  as he termed it. Certainly the peasants have preserved and handed down to
  the present time a vast number of old words, customs, and legends. It
  proves how much they owe to oral tuition.</p>

  <p class="author">A. B.</p>

  <p><i>Brogue and Fetch.</i>&mdash;There are a certain set of words which
  have become naturalised in English, by those who speak it in Ireland; as,
  <i>amadan</i>, a fool; <i>brogue</i>, a shoe (Ir. <i>brog</i>);
  <i>palaver</i>, fine speaking, soft talk (Ir. <i>pi-labhradh</i>). These
  are all Irish words; but there are others which are not English, and yet
  it is hard to make them out Irish. <i>Brogue</i>, meaning a broad Irish
  accent, is an instance; <i>fetch</i> is another:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In Ireland (says Mr. Banim) a <i>fetch</i> is the supernatural
  <i>fac-simile</i> of some individual, which comes to assure to its
  original [or his friend or relative] a happy longevity or immediate
  dissolution. If seen in the morning, the one event is predicted; if in
  the evening, the other."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>Taibhse</i> (pr. <i>thaivshe</i>) is the Irish word, and perhaps
  <i>fetch</i> might be derived from it by a sort of metathesis.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Eirionnach.</span></p>

  <p><i>Derivation of "Caul."</i>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Guianerius, cap. 36., <i>De Ægritud. Matr.</i>, speaks of a silly,
  jealous fellow, that, seeing his child new born, included in a
  <i>kell</i> (meaning a <i>caul</i>), thought sure a Franciscan, that used
  to come to his house, was the father of it, it was so like the friar's
  <i>cowl</i>, and thereupon threatened the friar to kill
  him!"&mdash;Burton's <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>, part iii. sec. 3.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>By this may we judge that <i>caul</i> and <i>cowl</i> are cognate?
  <i>Coif</i> (Martial.), in Latin <i>Reticulum</i>; whence a lady's
  <i>reticule</i>.</p>

  <p class="author">B. B.</p>

  <p><i>"Pandecte," an entire Copy of the Bible.</i>&mdash;Dr. Maitland, in
  his valuable essays on the <i>Dark Ages</i>, has drawn attention to this
  use of the word <i>Pandecte</i>, but was not at the time aware that it is
  so employed by any writer before Alcuin (p. 194. n. 9. ed. 1844). It will
  be found, however, in the following, extract from Bede's <i>Chronicon</i>
  (in <i>Monument. Britan.</i>, p. 101. <span class="sm">A</span>). The
  historian is speaking of certain presents which his abbot, Ceolfrith, was
  carrying with him on his pilgrimage to Rome, when death cut it short at
  Langres:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Qui inter alia donaria quæ adferre disposuerat, misit ecclesiæ S.

  fonte translatum."</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>BOY BISHOP AT ETON.</h3>

  <p>In Heywood's edition of the <i>Statutes of King's College, Cambridge,
  and Eton College</i> (Longman, 1850), a MS. is quoted under the title of
  <i>Consuetudinarium vetus Scholæ Etoniensis</i> (sic), Harl. MSS. 7044,
  p. 167. From a MS. in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.</p>

  <p>It is a sort of <i>Fasti Etonenses</i>, recording in somewhat quaint
  terms the old customs which were then traditionary in the school. In the
  month of November, according to this authority, "in die <!-- Page 558
  --><span class="pagenum" title="030.png"><a
  name="page558"></a>{558}</span>Sti Hugonis Pontificis solebat Etonæ fieri
  electio Episcopi Nihilensis, sed consuetudo obsolevit."</p>

  <p>Again, in the statutes as given by Mr. Heywood, p. 560., it is
  provided that on the Feast of St. Nicholas, but "nullatenus in festo
  Sanctorum Innocentium," the Episcopus puerorum Scholarium, who was to be
  elected from among the boys every year for the purpose, might celebrate
  all the divine offices except the "missæ secreta."</p>

  <p>Can you, or any of your correspondents, inform me&mdash;</p>

  <p>1st. What is the date of the MS. in question, with any further
  particulars of its history?</p>

  <p>2nd. What is "Pope St. Hugo's Day," and whether it was in any way
  connected with the election of the boy bishop in other places as well as
  Eton?</p>

  <p>3rd. Whether any reason can be assigned why Holy Innocents Day, being
  that on which the boy bishop was usually appointed, should have been
  expressly excluded by the founder.</p>

<h3>"¶ SPECULUM CHRISTIANORUM MULTA BONA CONTINENS."</h3>

  <p>I have a small black-letter tract which bears the above title: I am
  desirous of learning the author's name, and that of the printer, together
  with the date and place of its production. It extends from signature
  <span class="sm">A</span> 1 to <span class="sm">G</span> 8, and ends
  abruptly on the verso of <span class="sm">G</span> 8 without any
  colophon. On the verso of the title page is a small woodcut representing
  the Holy Dove hovering over the Virgin, who is surrounded by nine
  kneeling figures, all under a depressed arch, supported by two pillars
  whose shafts have a kind of chevron ornament worked on them, somewhat
  similar to the pillars of the crypt of Canterbury Cathedral. Perhaps if I
  give the title-page of this curious little tract in extenso, it will be
  more easily identified:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"¶ Speculum Christianorum multa bona continens. Primo modo.</p>
      <p>¶ De preceptis dei</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It should be noted that this table of contents is by no means a fair
  representative of the subjects on which the pamphlet treats. On the verso
  of page <span class="sm">E</span> iii. is the following curious
  passage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"¶ Peccata britonum et causa depositionis eorum. Negligentia
  prelatorum | rapina potent<span class="over">u</span> | cupiditas

  <p>This passage is introduced without any farther connexion with the
  subjects under discussion, than the mere heading of the section gives it.

<h3>MASSACRE OF THE WELSH BARDS.</h3>

  <p>Barrington, in his <i>Observations upon the Statutes</i>, raises some
  historic doubts whether that massacre of the Welsh bards, upon which Gray
  founded his magnificent ode, actually occurred:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"But", he says, "a manuscript history, written by Sir John Wynne of
  Gwydir, authorises the supposed tradition of a massacre of the bards; nor
  could the writer of that most admirable ode have made his bard so warmly
  express, or his reader feel, the tyranny of Edward, if he had not
  probably raised an indignation and fire in his own breast, and by reading
  of other materials, which <i>I have not happened to meet with</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Has the question of this real or pretended massacre been raised, or
  proved beyond doubt?</p>

  <p>As to Gray requiring "materials" for his fancy, poets even of inferior
  genius contrive to weave a web out of airy nothings, and the liveliest
  description by an old Cymric bard of the slaughters of the thirteenth
  century, will not carry conviction of the truth of the narrative in the
  nineteenth.</p>

  <p>"<i>Cease, rude Boreas.</i>"&mdash;Can any of your correspondents tell
  me why the song, "Cease, rude Boreas," has been occasionally attributed
  to Falconer. I remember seeing this song appended to an old edition of
  the <i>Shipwreck</i>, with a prefatory remark stating that G. A. Stevens
  <i>could</i> not have written it, as the moral of the verses was of too
  high an order for him. Occasionally the last stanza is omitted, on
  account of the sentiment being somewhat questionable; though it cannot be
  denied that the feelings there expressed are exactly those of a sailor.
  In a few copies another stanza of a very different tendency is inserted
  in its place; and at times I have seen the commencement of the third
  stanza altered thus:</p>

  appear to be in the shape of pictorial proverbs; they are evidently very
  old, the distich before each plate is in Latin, which is again written in
  old German. The views in each background are places generally in Germany,
  and the names are written on the plate itself. In <i>one only</i> plate I
  discover the name "M. Merian, fe" (Qy. Matts. Merian, or his daughter, of
  Frankfort?); and in some few others the following mark, "<img

  <p><i>Mormonism and Spalding's Romance.</i>&mdash;The extraordinary
  spread of Mormonism seems to stamp it as likely to prove a kind of second
  Mahometanism in the world's history. Under these circumstances the origin
  of the <i>Book of Mormon</i> is of course a literary curiosity. In a
  clever pamphlet entitled <i>Mormonism Exposed</i>, by John Bowes (E.
  Ward, 54. Paternoster Row, London), at pp. 30, 31. an account of the
  history of the book of Mormon is given. Mr. Bowes quotes from
  <i>Mormonism Unveiled</i>, by E. D. Hoare, to the effect that a Mr. "John
  Spalding" affirms that his (now deceased) brother "Solomon Spalding" had
  written "<i>an historical romance</i> of the first settlers in America,
  endeavoring to show that the American Indians are the descendants of
  Jews, or the lost tribes. It gave a detailed account of their journey
  from Jerusalem, by land and sea, till they arrived in America, under the
  command of <span class="sc">Nephi</span> and <span
  class="sc">Lehi</span>; he also mentions the Lamanites." Mr. J. Spalding,
  it is said, on reading the <i>Book of Mormon</i>, "to his great
  surprise," found "nearly the same historical matter, names, &amp;c., as
  they were in his brother's writings;" and further says "according to the
  best of my recollection and belief, it is the same as my brother Solomon
  wrote, with the exception of the religious matter." The latter is
  obviously taken from the Bible, with alterations and additions <i>ad
  libitum</i>.</p>

  <p>Can any of your readers tell whether this romance of Solomon
  Spalding's was ever published; or whether it is still in existence, and
  accessible for reference, &amp;c.?</p>

  <p><i>Carrs or Calves.</i>&mdash;In 1 Esdras v. 55. there occurs the word
  <i>carrs</i>. This is found in all copies of the Bible to which I have
  access, except one edited in the last century by a Mr. Butley, of Ch. Ch.

<h3>ST. PATRICK.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 520.)</p>

  <p>Allowing himself to be led astray by such an untruthful guide as
  Ledwich, your correspondent E. M. R. thinks that "there seems to be very
  great doubt if St. Patrick ever existed in reality." Had E. M. R. sought
  for, he might have found evidences of Ireland's apostle's existence
  beginning with the very lifetime itself of that saint. 1st. We have a
  short work from St. Patrick's own pen, the <i>Confessio</i>, which the
  best critics have allowed to be genuine: it commences thus: "Ego
  Patricius peccator," &amp;c. 2nd. A very old hymn, shown by Dr. O'Conor
  to have been written c. <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 540 (<i>Prol. in
  Rer. Hib. Vet. Script.</i>, p. lxxxix.), tells us that: "Patricius
  prædicabat Scotis." (<i>Ib.</i>, p. xciii.). 3rd. The Irish monk Adamnan,
  who died <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 704, that is, almost a half century
  before our Beda, in his <i>Life of St. Columba</i>, says: "Quidam
  proselytus Brito homo sanctus, sancti Patricii episcopi discipulus,"
  &amp;c. (<i>AA. SS. Junii</i>, t. ii. p. 197.). 4th. In the library of C.
  C. College, Cambridge, there is a MS. of the seventh century, containing
  the early Irish canons: "Synodus episcoporum id est Patricii, Auxillii,
  Issernini" (Nasmith's <i>Cat. C. C. C. C.</i>, p. 318.). 5th. The
  Antiphonal, once belonging to the Irish Bangor, but now in the Ambrosian
  Library, Milan, a MS. of the end of the seventh or beginning of the
  eighth century, and published by Muratori, has a "hymnum Sancti Patricii
  magistri Scotorum" (Muratori, <i>Anecd.</i>, t. iv. p. 89.). 6th.
  Cummian, writing about the Pascal question to the Abbot of Hy, <span
  class="sm">A.D.</span> 634, says: "Primum (cyclum) illum quem sanctus
  Patricius Papa noster tulit," &amp;c. (<i>Vet. Epist. Hibernicarum
  Syl.</i>, ed. Usserio, p. 21.). 7th. In the very old Litanies, once used,
  as it seems, by some church among the Britons living in this island
  beyond the reach of Anglo-Saxon control, we find invoked St. Patrick,
  along with SS. Brindane, Gildas, Paterne, Guinwaloc, Munna, Tutwal,
  German, and other lights of the Irish, as well as our ancient British
  church (ed. Mabillon, <i>Vet. Analect.</i>, p. 168.). 8th. St. Gertrude,
  Abbess of Nivelle, died on the 17th March, <span class="sm">A.D.</span>
  658; the writer of her life was her cotemporary, and he expressly
  mentions St. Patrick (<i>Vita S. Gertrudis</i>, ed. Mabillon. <i>AA. SS.
  O. B.</i>, t. ii. p. 447.). 9th. Our own Beda <i>did</i> insert St.
  Patrick's name in the Martyrology which he drew up (ed. Smith, <i>Bedæ
  Hist. Eccl.</i>, p. 351.); and another far-famed countryman of ours,
  Alcuin, who, in some verses which he composed for being placed "Ad aram
  SS. Patricii et aliorum Scotorum," says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Patricius, Cheranus, Scotorum gloria gentis,</p>
      <p>Atque Columbanus, Congallus, Adomnanus atque," &amp;c.</p>
      <p class="i10"><i>Opp.</i> ed. Frobenio, t. ii. p. 219.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>10th. A liturgical MS. in the British Museum, Nero, A, II. fo. 35. b.,
  which was first printed by Spelman, who calls it "codex vetustissimus"
  (<i>Concil.</i>, i. 176.), speaks of St. Patrick as "archiepiscopus in
  Scotiis et Britanniis" (<i>Ib.</i>, 177.). 11th. The celebrated monastery
  of St. Gall (an Irish saint) still possesses the fragment of what was
  once a missal, and written in the Irish character. This codex must have
  been older than the ninth century, for it is set down "inter libros
  Scottice scriptos" in a catalogue of the books belonging to that library,
  made in the ninth century. Among the saints enumerated in the canon of
  the mass is Patrick the bishop, "intercedentibus pro nobis beatis
  apostolis Petro et Paulo et Patricio æpiscopo" (see the fragment in
  <i>Appendix A to Cooper's Report</i>, p. 95.).</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Pyrrho</span> has had, and is likely always to have,
  followers in every age and country: Hardouin would not allow that Virgil
  ever lived, but stoutly held that the <i>Æneid</i> was "a fardel of
  monkish fictions" put together during the middle ages: not "the bigoted
  Anglo-Saxons" of the eighth, but Dr. Ledwich of the eighteenth century,
  denied the existence of the great St. Patrick; a few weeks ago a
  correspondent of "N. &amp; Q." asked "Is not the battle itself (of
  Waterloo) a myth?" (Vol. v., p. 396.); and last week, another tells us
  that "the saint (Patrick) certainly vanishes into 'an airy nothing,' if
  we are to credit the above authors" (Dr. Ledwich and Dr. Aikin).</p>

  <p>Who the Aikin may be, or what the work of his which E. M. R. has
  brought forwards, I do not know; Ledwich's book now lies before me, and a
  more prejudiced writer I have never met with. I think, however, that from
  the above authorities it is clearly shown that, together with all the
  most learned of early and modern times, we are still warranted in
  treating St. Patrick "as a real actor in Irish ecclesiastical
  affairs."</p>

  <p><i>Sir James Ware&mdash;St. Patrick's Birth-place</i> (Vol. v., p.
  520.)&mdash;Permit me to correct your correspondent E. M. R., who, by a
  strange mistake, calls Sir James Ware "a Roman Catholic writer." He was a
  zealous member of the church of Ireland: E. M. R. will see a memoir of
  him in Harris's edition of Ware's <i>Writers of Ireland</i>.</p>

  <p>With respect to the birth-place of St. Patrick, your correspondent may
  consult Colgan's <i>Trias Thaumaturga, Append. quinta ad vitas S.
  Patricii</i>, <!-- Page 562 --><span class="pagenum" title="034.png"><a

  St. Patrick by Harris in his edition of Ware's <i>Bishops of Ireland</i>;

<h3>NASHE'S "TERRORS OF THE NIGHT."</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 467.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Eastwood's</span> quotation from Nashe's
  <i>Terrors of the Night</i> regarding the use of ale for the sacrament in
  Iceland, may have some light thrown upon it by the following passages
  from the Icelandic sages and the learned editors of the <i>Historic
  Memorials of Greenland</i>. We doubt if Nashe was correct in saying that
  ale was granted for that purpose by the Pope in preference to wine, on
  account of the "incessant frosts there;" for, in truth, the Icelanders of
  the present day, as well as in former times, have no difficulty in
  protecting liquids much more congealable, such as milk, from the winter's
  frost. The abundance of warm springs, and the volcanic fires throughout
  the island, render the temperature of the inhabited districts of Iceland
  much warmer in winter than would be supposed from its high northern
  latitude. The word "red emayle" no doubt means "red enamel," an apt
  simile enough, and well understood in the writer's days. We do not find
  any mention of "ale" ("öl") being ever used in Iceland for the
  celebration of the eucharist; but a wine seems to leave been prepared
  from the Crowberry (<i>Empetrum nigrum</i>), as is shown by the following
  extract from Bishop Paul's <i>Saga</i>, a nearly cotemporary history; for
  the <i>Saga</i> in question is believed to have been written by Bishop
  Magnus Gissurson (1215-1237), who succeeded Bishop Paul in the see of
  Skalholt:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In Bishop Paul's days came Bishop John from Greenland to Iceland, and
  remained during the winter in the eastern fiords; but afterwards he
  journeyed late in Lent (<i>langaföstu</i>, long fast time) to Skalholt to
  meet Bishop Paul, and he came there on Maunday Thursday
  (Skírdegi-Skjærtorsdag), and these two bishops consecrated a large store
  of Chrism, and had besides many confidential and learned conversations.
  Bishop John taught the people to prepare wine from the crowberry
  (krækiberium), as he himself had been instructed by King Sverrer. But it
  so happened that the next summer few berries grew in Iceland; but a man
  called Erick, who lived on a farm called Snorrastade, near Skalholt,
  prepared a small quantity of the wine from these berries, which succeeded
  well that summer."&mdash;Pp. 186, 187.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>We confess that we are much inclined to agree with the learned Eggert
  Olafsen's doubts as to the practicability of manufacturing a wine, to
  suit at least our palates, from the acrid fruit of the <i>Empetrum
  nigrum</i>. It is said that Boerhaave, gives a receipt for this purpose,
  and we have accordingly found it in his forty-second <i>Process of the
  Elementa Chemiæ</i>, but this relates to the general mode of producing
  wine from fruits; and Olafsen (p. 172. vol. i.) tried it in vain with the
  crowberry when in Iceland in 1753. Still a species of subacid drink, such
  as still prepared from this fruit by the Icelanders, may have been
  dignified in olden times with the name of wine; but Olafsen was certainly
  in error when he stated that Bishop Paul brought over to Iceland,
  according to tradition, a native of the Canary Isles, to teach the art.
  The Canary Isles were not then (<span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1203) known
  to Europe.</p>

  <p>About the year 1186 King Sverrer forbade the importation of wine into
  Bergen by the German traders, on account of the scenes of drunkenness and
  riot that ensued therefrom; and he is said to have turned his attention
  to the preparing of a home-made wine from the crowberry, as a substitute
  for the foreign liquors he had forbidden. The learned editors of the
  <i>Historic Memorials of Greenland</i>, in a note on the passage above
  quoted in Bishop Paul's <i>Saga</i>, remark, that this was probably the
  kind of wine which is traditionally said to have been used for the
  sacrament in Iceland when the true juice of the grape could not be
  obtained. Huidtfeldt, in his Chronicle, positively states that the
  Northmen in 1250 and 1290 sought and obtained permission from the Pope to
  use mead, "mjod" (mulsum), and other similar liquors, in the celebration
  of the sacrament, in consequence of the great scarcity of wine in those
  countries. The editors further state that "within our own times, during
  the disastrous war with England, it was proposed to employ wine made from
  bilberries for the same purpose in Iceland."</p>

  <p>The Synod of Roeskilde, according to Pontoppidan, <i>Annal. Eccles.
  Dan.</i> ii. 329. and iii. 538., forbids the use of any liquor but pure
  wine in the sacrament in the following words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Pastores sunt admoniti ad communionem uti, non <i>musto</i> aut aliis
  liquoribus illicitis, sed puro vino, juxta institutionem."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Lastly, in Rymer's <i>F&oelig;dera</i>, vol. x. p. 762., there is a
  petition from the Bishop of Skalholt to the English government in 1440,
  stating the depressed state of the commerce of Iceland at that period,
  and that no <i>wine, beer, or indeed any liquor</i> except milk and
  water, was to be found in the country. Such was its wretched condition,
  that he expresses his fear, unless supplies were received from England,
  divine service, the celebration of the communion, and of baptism, would
  soon cease.</p>

  <p>From this last document it would seem that <i>wine</i> was no longer
  made in Iceland from the crowberry, and that the fermented juice of the
  <!-- Page 563 --><span class="pagenum" title="035.png"><a
  name="page563"></a>{563}</span>grape was deemed absolutely necessary by
  the bishop of that day for the celebration of the sacrament. We are not
  aware of any decree or bull of the court of Rome, by which any other
  liquor than that obtained from the grape was permitted to be used, as
  such would be entirely contrary to all the canons of the church, and the
  opinions of all her theologians.</p>

<h3>THE OLD COUNTESS OF DESMOND.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., pp. 145. 323.)</p>

  <p>In your Number of "N. &amp; Q." of April 3rd, there are some curious
  and interesting remarks by the <span class="sc">Knight of Kerry</span>,
  respecting that wonder for length of days, the old Countess of Desmond,
  in which he gives the copy of an inscription on an ancient painting,
  stating that in the year 1614, and in the 140th year of her age, she
  appeared at the court of King James, to seek relief in consequence of the
  House of Desmond having been ruined by attainder. That this statement in
  the inscription is erroneous, can, I think, be proved by the following
  circumstances, which also seem to me to afford some light on the most
  obscure parts of the question.</p>

  <p>I have at this moment before me a work, which has been for many years
  in the library of my husband (the Rev. E. A. Bray, the Vicar of this
  place), and highly prized by us both, namely, a most perfect and
  beautiful copy of Sir Walter Raleigh's <i>History of the World</i>,
  published in 1614. I here give the date from the engraved title-page,
  which is of an allegorical description:</p>

<p class="ac">
"THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD."<br />
"AT LONDON: PRINTED FOR WALTER BVRRE."<br />
"1614."
</p>

  <p>In this volume, Chapter V. (of "the first Booke of the first Part"),
  page 66., "Of the long Lives of the Patriarchs, and some of <i>late
  memory</i>," after enumerating several celebrated persons who lived to
  great ages, Raleigh thus speaks of the old Countess:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I myself knew the old Countess of Desmond of Inchiquin, in Munster,
  who lived in the yeare 1589, and many years since, who was married in
  Edward IV.'s time, and held her joynture from all the Earls of Desmond
  since then; and that this is true, all noblemen and gentlemen of Munster
  can witnesse."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>From this passage I think it can be shown, that the reader can draw no
  other inference than that the Countess of Desmond was dead at the time
  Sir Walter Raleigh wrote it. In his heading to the chapter he speaks of
  some of "<i>late memory</i>;" and the words "<i>many years since</i>"
  evidently mean that she lived many years <i>after</i> 1589.<a
  name="footnotetag4" href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> We do not know
  at what precise period the above passage was penned; but we learn from
  Sir Walter's Preface, that he composed this great and admirable work
  whilst a prisoner in the Tower (from which he was liberated in 1616). In
  that preface he speaks with deep feeling and regret for the loss of
  Prince Henry. He says <i>the Prince read part of the work</i>; and that
  he wrote it "for the service of that inestimable" youth. We know that
  Henry died in November, 1612. The passage, therefore, about the "old
  Countess," which occurs in a very early part of the book, there can be no
  doubt, was written before 1612, and the entire work published in 1614.
  If, therefore (as I think no one can doubt, from the manner in which it
  is worded), the old lady was dead when Sir Walter wrote about her, it is
  not possible she could have visited the court of King James in 1614.</p>

  <p>As Raleigh says "I myself knew the old Countess <!-- Page 565 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="037.png"><a name="page565"></a>{565}</span>of
  Desmond," and plainly declares that she was married in the time of Edward
  IV., it is most probable that he received this account from herself at
  all events, when he so strongly appeals to the witness of "all the
  noblemen and gentlemen of Munster" for the truth of his statement, it is
  most unlikely he would have written thus merely on common or casual
  report. The <span class="sc">Knight of Kerry</span> says, "There are
  statements in existence of 1464 being the year of her birth." This is
  most probably the correct date, which is perfectly consistent with
  Raleigh's account of her marriage in the reign of Edward IV. It is likely
  she married very young. There is every probability that Raleigh was well
  acquainted with the "old Countess" when he was in Ireland, and acted so
  gallant a part against the rebels in that country. Early in the spring of
  1581, upon the Earl of Ormond leaving Ireland, Captain Raleigh (for he
  was then only such), with Sir William Morgan and another gentleman,
  received a commission to succeed the Earl for a time in his government in
  <i>Munster</i> (the old lady's county), and he spent the summer there of
  that year. It may be further remarked, that the then Earl of Desmond and
  <i>Sir John Desmond</i> are among the rebels, and that therefore the
  House of Desmond did suffer by attainder <i>in the reign of
  Elizabeth</i>;<a name="footnotetag5" href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
  and more likely was it that the aged Countess should sue at the Court of
  Elizabeth for relief, than twenty years after at that of Jas. I.</p>

  <p>If she came to England in 1589, Sir Walter Raleigh might have seen her
  in her pilgrimage to his royal mistress in that year, as in <i>that
  year</i> (the next after the defeat of the Spanish Armada, in which
  glorious service he bore a distinguished part), among other honours
  conferred upon him, was that of being appointed one of the gentlemen of
  her Majesty's Privy Chamber. In 1614 Raleigh was a prisoner in the Tower;
  and very improbable is it that, even had she been living at that date and
  in England, the old Countess would there have paid him a visit, to thank
  him for his mention of her in his <i>History of the World</i>. And,
  finally, had she really been alive when he wrote it, he might have
  referred to the lady herself, as a proof of what he said about her being
  true, instead of referring to "all the noblemen and gentlemen in
  Munster."</p>

  <p>As the <span class="sc">Knight of Kerry</span> has expressed a wish to
  receive the opinions of your readers who take an interest in the subject,
  I venture to offer the foregoing remarks, in consequence of having the
  very valuable copy of Raleigh's great work in our possession, and shall
  be happy if the few observations I have made may be in any respect
  acceptable to him or to your readers.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Knight of Kerry</span>, in his very interesting
  letter, infers that if the old Countess of Desmond was only eight or nine
  years old at the death of Edward IV., she therefore could not have been
  married during the reign of that monarch. Was it not, however, a not
  uncommon custom, at that period, for royal and noble infants to be given
  in marriage at quite as early an age as eight or nine, whenever it suited
  the views, political or otherwise, of their parents or guardians?</p>

<h3>A FEW THINGS ABOUT RICHARD BAXTER.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 481.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent <span class="sc">Mr. Bealby</span> mentions that in
  his visit to Kidderminster in 1836, he was shown the house in the High
  Street in which Richard Baxter is said to have resided: a few more
  particulars on the subject may prove interesting.</p>

  <p>It was a three storied, high gabled house, with low ceilinged rooms,
  lighted by long ranges of casement. The exterior of the house displayed a
  goodly proportion of wood-work, and appeared to be much in its original
  condition. No garden or extra-ground was attached to it, another street
  (Swan Street) running immediately at its back. Three or four years since
  the house fell before the march of modern improvements, and none of its
  old features can now be recognised. At the time of these alterations, the
  house was tenanted by a shoemaker. An ascent of four or five steps led
  into the shop, the long low window of which, projecting somewhat over the
  pavement, was tiled above, and supported underneath by wooden pillars.
  These also served to mark the boundary allotted to the display of the
  handiwork of the basketmaker who plied his trade in the capacious cellar
  underneath the shop.</p>

  <p>Of course <span class="sc">Mr. Bealby</span>, while prosecuting in
  Kidderminster his inquiries about Baxter, visited Caldwall Castle (close
  to the town), once the <!-- Page 566 --><span class="pagenum" title="038.png"
  ><a name="page566"></a>{566}</span>residence of Sir Ralph Clare, Baxter's
  sturdy opponent. In an old map of the town, the castle is represented as
  having eight towers; but only one of these now remains, which is attached
  to a modern house. The tower is octagonal, built of red sandstone, of
  massive proportions, and is in good preservation. It contains two rooms
  lighted N. and S.; a turret staircase; and a groin-roofed cellar, level
  with the ground, and with an exterior door. From this cellar an
  underground passage is said to extend to St. Mary's Church, about a
  quarter of a mile distant. Sir Ralph Clare was buried in St. Mary's,
  opposite to where Baxter's pulpit then stood. The flat stone that covers
  his grave has once again been restored to the light by the removal of the
  cumbrous sleeping-box that concealed it,&mdash;thanks to the judicious
  alterations now being carried on by the present vicar; alterations very
  different to those "beautifyings" of 1786, in which Baxter's pulpit was
  sold as worthless lumber. (Vide "N. &amp; Q.,", Vol. v., p. 363.)</p>

  <p>The Registers preserved in the vestry of St. Mary's attest the careful
  neatness of Baxter in his official entries. The headings of the different
  months are printed, and, in some cases, ornamented after the missal
  style. Many of the burials are set down as those of "valliant souldiers,"
  who fell in the frequent skirmishes of those troublous times.</p>

  <p>The row of elms on the south walk of the churchyard is said to have
  been planted in Baxter's time,&mdash;perhaps by his own hand.</p>

  <p>If <span class="sc">Mr. Bealby</span> would like a copy of my etching
  of Baxter's pulpit (referred to at p. 363.), and would leave his address
  with the Publisher of "N. &amp; Q.," I should be happy to forward one to
  him.</p>

<h3>ST. BOTULPH.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., pp. 396. 475.)</p>

  <p>As no one has hitherto answered the inquiries of A. B. touching St.
  Botulph, I beg to forward you the following Notes. The earliest mention
  of him will be found in the <i>Saxon Chronicle</i>, at the year 654. He
  is said to have then commenced the building of a minster at
  <i>Ycean-ho</i>. The statement is repeated by Florence of Worcester, who
  writes the name of St. Botulph's convent <i>Ikanho</i>. Its locality is
  thus pointed out by Leland, <i>Itinerary</i>, i. 31, 32. ed.
  Hearne:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Some hold opinion that est of Lincoln were 2 suburbs, one toward S.
  Beges, a late [of late] a cell of S. Mari abbay at York; the which place
  I take be <i>Icanno</i>, wher was an house of monkes in S. Botolphes
  tyme, and of this speketh Bede[?]. It is scant half a mile from the
  minster."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The same writer has informed us (viii. 68.) that St. Botulph died in
  Icanno (15 Kal. Jun.), and that the monastery was soon afterwards
  destroyed by the Scandinavian vikings. The authority on which this latter
  statement will be found to rest is a "Life of St. Botulph," written or
  embellished by John Capgrave, and included in his <i>Nova Legenda
  Angliæ</i>. I have now before me a fine copy of the work (Lond. 1516);
  but very few of the events in which St. Botulph is there said to have
  played a part belong to the sphere of history. We learn that Botulphus
  and Adulphus were two noble brothers, who in early life were sent into
  "Old Saxony" to be instructed in monastic learning. Botulph there became
  acquainted with two sisters of an English king, named Ethelmund ("regis
  australium Anglorum"), who, at their wish, allotted to the monk a piece
  of barren ground, on which to build a convent ("locum quendam incultum et
  ab hominibus desertum Ykanho vocatum.") Like other marshy spots, in which
  the <i>ignis fatuus</i> abounded, it was thought to be infested by
  malignant spirits. These were soon, however, put to flight ("edito crucis
  signo"), and a convent, on the model of the house in which St. Botulph
  had been reared, was planted in the midst of their domain. It perished
  under Edmund (941-946); but the relics of St. Botulph, which had been
  enshrined in his own foundation, were preserved, and afterwards
  translated, in the time of Edgar (959-975), through the efforts of St.
  Ethelwold. The head was sent to Ely, and the body equally apportioned to
  the royal cabinet of relics and the abbey church of Thorne. The closing
  passage is as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In libro ecclesie Sancti Botulphi juxta Aldersgate Londo<span
  class="over">n</span> habetur quæ pars corporis Sancti Botulphi per bone
  memorie regem Edwardum ecclesie B. Petri Westmonasterii est collata.
  Eodem etiam tempore, ut in quibusdam locis scriptum inveni, per eundem
  monachum, jubente episcopo Ethelwoldo, translata sunt apud Thornense
  monasterium ossa Benedicti Biscop, abbatis venerabilis Wermuthensis,
  nutritoris Bede presbiteri. Construxit autem Sanctus Ethelwoldus non
  longe a monasterio Thornensi, in loco ubi <i>beata virgo Christi Toua
  inclusa</i> fuerat, lapideam ecclesiolam delicatissimis cameratam
  cancellulis et duplici area tribus dedicatam altaribus permodicis,
  undique usque ad eius muros vallatam arboribus diversi generis. Sedem ibi
  heremiticam, si permisisset Deus, sibi delegit."</p>

  <p class="address">St. Catharine's Hall, Cambridge.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[Leland notices this female solitary. St. Tova, or Tona, was a Saxon
  saint, to whose memory a fair chapel, called Thoveham, or Thona, half a
  mile from the abbey, was consecrated; and at this place was the oratory
  of the Heremites. Lelandi <i>Collectanea</i>, vol. i. p. 28.; Willis'
  <i>Mitred Abbies</i>, vol. i. p. 187.&mdash;<span

</div>

  <p>The earliest mention found of this saint is in the <i>Saxon
  Chronicle</i>, under the year 654, when he began to build his minster at
  Ycean-ho, probably Boston or Botulph's-town in Lincolnshire. His <!--
  Page 567 --><span class="pagenum" title="039.png"><a
  name="page567"></a>{567}</span>life was first put into regular form by
  Fulcard, a monk of Thorney, who was made abbot of that monastery in 1068.
  Fulcard tells us in his preface what his materials were:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Reperta sunt quædam in veteribus libris vitiose descripta, quædam ab
  ipso præcipuo præsuli in privilegiis ejusdem c&oelig;nobii sunt breviter
  annotata, cætera ex relatione veterum ut ab antiquioribus sunt eis
  exhibita."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>An early MS. of this life is in the Harleian collection, No. 3097. It
  was printed (somewhat curtailed) by Capgrave in the <i>Legenda Nova</i>,
  and seems to have furnished all that our antiquaries know about St.
  Botulph. Camden indeed refers to <i>Bede</i>, iv. 3., as containing some
  mention of him; but I can find no such passage, and I believe that
  Botulph is nowhere mentioned in the <i>Historia Anglorum</i>. The remains
  of Botulph were taken up in the days of King Edgar, and his head was
  allotted to Ely, while the rest of his bones were divided between the
  abbeys of Thorney and Westminster. The cause of his extended popularity
  it is difficult to discover. His fame even passed over to Denmark, and an
  office is allotted to him in the Sleswick Breviary, <i>Britannia
  Sacra</i>, vol. i. p. 370. It has been surmised that he was a patron
  saint of seamen, and that his name indicates this character, <i>i. e.</i>
  boat-help! See Allen's <i>History of Lincoln</i>, vol. i. p. 245. His
  brother Adulf was made Bishop of Trajectum, probably Utrecht. Your
  correspondents may be referred to Capgrave; to Leland,
  <i>Collectanea</i>, vol. i. p. 217., and vol. iii. p. 33.; and to Ellis's
  <i>Monasticon</i>, vol. ii. p. 596., and vol. vi. p. 1621. St. Botulph's
  day is the 17th of June.</p>

<h3>SIR RICHARD POLE, THE FATHER OF CARDINAL POLE.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., pp. 105. 163.)</p>

  <p>Without presuming to contravene the high authorities quoted by J. G.
  N. on the pedigree of Sir Richard Pole, the father of the celebrated
  Cardinal Pole, I am inclined to the belief that he descended from a
  common ancestor with the Cheshire family of "Poole," as suggested by your
  correspondent I. J. H. H. Wotton<a name="footnotetag6"
  href="#footnote6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> says, in his pedigree of "Poole,
  baronets of Poole" (from whom, by the way, the <i>Poles</i> of Shute
  collaterally derived):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Robert Pull, <i>alias</i> Poole, <i>alias</i> De la Poole, lord of
  Barretspoole, 8 Edw. I., by Elizabeth, dau. to Hugh Raby, had issue
  <i>Reginald</i> and others. Reginald had issue James, who died 1 Edw.
  II., leaving Robert de Pull, his son and heir, who m., 2 Rich. II., the
  dau. and heir of Thomas de Capenhurst. Sir John de Pull, Knight, his son,
  lived 8 Hen. IV. and 3 Hen. V., and was father of Sir John <i>Poole</i>,
  of Poole, in Wirrall, living about 19 Rich. II., who by a dau. of
  &mdash;&mdash; Mainwaring, of Peover, had issue, 1. Sir Thomas Poole,
  Knight, lord of Poole and Capenhurst, 35 Hen. VI. 2. Robert Poole, who
  left posterity. 3. <i>Sir Richard Poole, Knight</i>, who had progeny; and
  4. James, grandfather to John Poole, of Stratford in Essex."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Is anything known further of the above Sir Richard Poole, Knight, or
  of his "progeny"? From a comparison of the dates before given with that
  of the time in which the father of the Cardinal flourished, it seems not
  improbable (in the absence of direct proof to the contrary) that he
  removed into Buckinghamshire, and was father of "Geoffry Pole," who
  married Edith St. John, as shown. Cardinal Pole, however, was born (in
  1500) at Stoverton Castle in <i>Worcestershire</i>, and the fact that he
  was named Reginald, as borne by the son of Robert, the first ancestor of
  "Poole" (as shown in the above extract), as well as by other members of
  the baronet family, would tend to confirm the supposition of a common
  ancestry. The reasons for the change in the family bearing suggested by
  J. G. N. seem highly probable, besides being the usual course adopted by
  younger sons for difference. I would here suggest another Query: Was Sir
  Richard, or his son Henry, created Lord Montague? Burke seems to be at
  variance with other testimony I have found on the matter. He says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Sir Richard Pole, K.G., [was] summoned to Parliament in 1553 [Query,
  1503], as Baron Montague: he m. Lady Margaret Plantagenet, dau. of Geo.
  Duke of Clarence, and left issue four sons and one daughter, viz. Henry,
  <i>second Baron</i> Montague (whose daughters and coheirs were,
  Katherine, wife of Francis, second Earl of Huntingdon; and Winifred, m.
  first to Sir Thomas Hastings, and, secondly, to Sir Thomas Barrington).
  2. Geffery, Sir. 3. Arthur. 4. Reginald, the celebrated Cardinal. 5.
  Ursula, m. to Henry Lord Stafford."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In a list of attainders appended to the 2nd volume of Debrett's
  <i>Peerage</i>, the date 1504 is given as the creation, and 1538 the
  forfeiture of the title. Wotton says (vol. i. p. 32.):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Sir Thomas Barrington, high sheriff of Essex and Hertford, 4 Eliz."
  1561, "m. Winifred d. and coheir of Henry Pole, <i>Lord Mountague</i>
  (son of Sir Richard Pole, <i>Knight of the Garter</i>" only), "by
  Margaret Countess of Salisbury, dau. to Geo. Duke of Clarence, brother to
  King Edward VI."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>That "marvellous" historian, Sir Richard Baker, in his
  <i>Chronicle</i> (ed. 1696, pp. 246. 271. 286., &amp;c.), records, under
  the reign of Hen. VII. (cir. 1503):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Prince Arthur, after his marriage, was sent again into Wales, to keep
  <i>that country in good order</i>, to whom were appointed for councillors
  Sir Richard <i>Pool</i>, his <i>kinsman</i> and chief chamberlain, Sir
  Henry Vernon," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I find no trace of the title till 15 Hen. VIII. (1524): <!-- Page 568
  --><span class="pagenum" title="040.png"><a
  name="page568"></a>{568}</span></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"All this while King Henry had play'd with the French, but now he
  seems to be in earnest, and therefore sends over the Duke of Suffolk with
  an army, the four and twentieth of August, attended with the Lord
  Montacute and his <i>brother</i>, <i>Sir</i> Arthur Pool, with many other
  knights and gentlemen."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>On the knighthood of this <i>Sir</i> Arthur I find, farther
  on,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"On <i>Allholland</i> (Query, All-hallows) day, in the chief church of
  Roy," (the Duke) "made knights, Lord Herbert (son of the Earl of
  Worcester), the Lord Powis, Oliver Manners, Arthur Pool, &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And now&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The 3rd Nov. (1538) Henry Courtney, Marquess of Exeter and Earl of
  Devonshire, <i>Henry Pool</i>, <i>Lord Montacute</i>, Sir Nicholas Carew,
  of Bedington, Knight of the Garter and Master of the Horse, and Sir
  Edward Nevill, brother to the Lord <i>Aburgenny</i>, were sent to the
  Tower, being accused by Sir Geoffry <i>Pool</i>, the Lord Montacute's
  brother, of high treason. They were indicted for devising to promote and
  advance <i>one Reinald</i> (Qy. Reginald) <i>Pool</i> to the crown, and
  <i>put down</i> K. Henry. <i>This Pool was a near kinsman of the
  king's</i> (being the son of the Lady Margaret, Countess of Salisbury,
  daughter and heir to George, Duke of Clarence). He had been brought up by
  the king in learning, and made Dean of Exeter; but being <i>after
  sent</i> to learn experience by travel, he grew so great a friend of the
  Pope's that he became an enemy to King Henry, and <i>for his enmity to
  the king</i> was by Pope Julius III. made cardinal. For this man's cause
  the lords aforesaid being condemned were all executed; the Lord Marquess,
  the Lord Montacute, and Sir Edward Nevill, beheaded on the Tower Hill the
  ninth of January; Sir Nicholas Carew the third of March; two priests
  condemned with them were hanged at Tyburn: Sir Geoffry <i>Pool</i>,
  though condemned also, yet had his pardon."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I give this last quotation entire (hoping to be pardoned for its
  length), as it affords a curious insight into the eventful history of the
  period; for, two years later, I find it on record that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Reynold Pool, Cardinal</i>, brother to the Lord Montacute, was
  with divers others attainted of high treason; of whom Foskeue and Dingley
  the tenth of July were beheaded, the Countess of Salisbury two years
  after."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But I forbear quoting further the account of this same cardinal's
  pompous "<i>absolution of these realms</i>," and "<i>reconciliation to
  the church of Rome</i>," all which are given in "marvellous" detail by
  our worthy historian. I pass on to observe, in conclusion, that, from the
  fact (as recorded in the first of the foregoing historic extracts) that
  "Sir Richard <i>Pool</i>, chamberlain" to Prince Arthur, was sent by him
  into <i>Wales</i>, I gather your correspondent I. J. H. H. has been led
  to suppose him a <i>Welsh knight</i>. That he is called a <i>kinsman</i>
  of the prince is also some confirmation of the statement afforded by J.
  G. N., that he became so by his mother's near connexion with the Countess
  of Richmond, but his own alliance with the house of Plantagenet must have
  taken place about the close of the fifteenth century (and I own this
  offers some objection to my theory of his descent); it could not have
  occurred in 1513, as your correspondent states, since Cardinal Pole was,
  as I have stated, born in 1500, and was therefore fifty-four years old at
  the commencement of Mary's reign, viz. 1553-4, when proposals were made
  for his marriage with the queen; for, says Sir Richard, once more, in
  speaking, of "the marriages propounded for Queen Mary:"</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"One was Cardinal Pool, of a dignity not much inferior to kings, and
  by his mother descended from kings; <i>but there was an exception against
  him also, because four and fifty years old</i> (as old a batchelor as
  Queen Mary was a maid)," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>May I be allowed to suggest another Query as to the value of the
  aforesaid dignity of knighthood, since Lord Herbert and Lord Powis
  accepted it with men of plainer name and "lesser note." I should feel
  obliged to any of your correspondents for information on this point.</p>

<h3>PROCLAMATIONS TO PROHIBIT THE USE OF COAL.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 513.)</p>

  <p>I have recently, for a definite purpose, searched for facts relative
  to the introduction of coal into domestic use, but I have not met with
  the case referred to by Dr. Bachhoffner. So harsh a measure appears
  somewhat inconsistent with other facts connected with the early history
  of coal. For instance, a grant, dated 7th May, in the 34th of Edward I.
  tolerates the introduction of sea-coal into London, but levies a toll of
  sixpence upon every ship-load passing London Bridge: "De qualibet navata
  carbonis maris venal. sex denarios" (Hearne's <i>Liber Niger
  Scaccarii</i>: Lond. 1774, 8vo. p. 480.), which toll was to be applied to
  the maintenance of the said bridge. A few months after this, in 1306, was
  issued the proclamation prohibiting its use; and on its being
  disregarded, was, as stated by Prynne, followed by a Commission of Oyer
  and Terminer in the year 1307, a short time before the death of Edward I.
  It is pretty evident that on the accession of Edward II. a great change
  occurred in the opinion of the authorities respecting the use of coal;
  for in the year 1308 fifty pounds (equal probably to 800<i>l.</i> of our
  money) were paid from the Exchequer to provide wood and <i>coal</i> for
  the king's coronation. (<i>Issue Roll, Excheq.</i>, 1 Edw. II.) This sum
  was paid to John Fairhod, Thomas de Hales, Thomas Wastel, Roger le White,
  and John de Talworth. We cannot tell the quantity of coal used on that
  occasion; but, in addition to the above sum we find Richard del Hurst of
  London petitioning Parliament for the payment of ten <!-- Page 569
  --><span class="pagenum" title="041.png"><a
  name="page569"></a>{569}</span>shillings to him for sea-coal supplied at
  the king's coronation. (<i>Rot. Parl.</i>, 15 and 16 Edw. II., vol. i. p.
  405.) Many facts might be given to show that coal was frequently used in
  London during the reign of Edward II.; and unless we are to infer that
  the king used without hesitation that which was denied to the citizens on
  pain of death, we cannot suppose that any such stringent measure was in
  force as to render the use of coal a capital offence. The period,
  therefore, in which the case referred to by Dr. Bachhoffner occurred, was
  most probably during the last few months of the reign of Edw. I. But I am
  not acquainted with any record of the case, and, with <span
  class="sc">Mr. Wilson</span>, should feel obliged if any of your
  correspondents can refer me to it. But perhaps the Doctor himself will
  kindly answer the Query.</p>

  <p><i>The Amber Witch</i> (Vol. v., p. 510.).&mdash;In answer to a Query
  of A. N., this book is a pure fiction. Some German biblical critics
  pretending to decide that whole chapters, or whole books, of the Bible
  are spurious, from internal evidence, Meinhold wrote the <i>Amber
  Witch</i> to show how little able they were to judge of internal evidence
  in a much simpler case. Several of them fell into his trap, and then the

  a <i>double ford</i> at Alnmouth, a little above the town. The ancient
  church, called Woden's Church, stood at the mouth of the Alne. Here was
  found the cross with the imperfect inscription in Anglo-Saxon runes, now
  preserved at Alnwick Castle. I am not aware that any local tradition now
  connects the name of Twyford with Alnmouth.</p>

  <p><i>Brass of Lady Gore</i> (Vol. v., p. 412.).&mdash;This brass still
  exists, and commemorates Maria Gore, <i>Priorissa</i>, 1436, attired
  simply as a widow. Owing to its actual existence having been but recently
  known to collectors of rubbings, no mention was made of it in the
  <i>Oxford Manual</i>. For the same reason there is no notice of a very
  interesting brass of a bishop or abbot, date end of fourteenth century,
  at Adderley, Salop. The editor of the above work would take this
  opportunity of thanking <span class="sc">Mr. W. S. Simpson</span> for his
  corrections ("N. &amp; Q.," Vol. v., p. 369.). The rubbing, or rather
  smudging, from which the inscription was copied being nearly wholly
  illegible, accounts for the mistakes. Any further corrections will
  oblige</p>

  <p><i>Gospel Trees.</i>&mdash;Several Numbers of "N. &amp; Q." have
  contained interesting notices of trees which are traditionally reported
  to indicate the standing-places of out-door preachers. To me, there is
  something very pleasing and picturesque&mdash;if nothing better&mdash;in
  these narrations; and I shall therefore be glad to find them recurring in
  your pages, whether their claims are of ancient or later date. Every
  reader of the vigorous poetry of Ebenezer Elliott, a true member of the
  <i>genus irritabile</i>, will recollect Miles Gordon "the Ranter"
  preacher, and how, in the poet's lines,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2hg3">"&mdash;&mdash;The great unpaid! the prophet, lo!</p>
      <p>Sublime he stands beneath the Gospel tree,</p>
      <p>And Edmund stands on Shirecliffe at his side."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The context, too long to quote here, is a passage descriptive of the
  scenery in the vicinity of Sheffield in one direction, unsurpassed for
  graphic scope, freshness, and fidelity in the whole range of English
  rhyme. But the tree? Hundreds of summer visitors climb the hill, and ask
  <i>that</i> question; and they are pointed to an ash, which stands in a
  situation conspicuous enough, but which neither the rest of "the trees of
  the wood," if they could speak, nor the quarryman, who remembers it when
  a sappling can allow to be <i>the</i> veritable "Gospel tree" of the
  poet, though, but for <i>this</i> memorandum in "N. &amp; Q.," it might
  arrive at that distinction in the course of another century. A
  neighbouring tree, an oak, which those matter-of-fact judges, the
  trigonometrical surveyors, have marked with a lofty pole, competes with
  the aforesaid ash for the reverence of pilgrims but its claim is equally
  apocryphal. If, however, when on the spot, "it is difficult," according
  to the old adage, "to find the tree for the wood," as I experienced a few
  days since, it will ever stand conspicuous enough, in the poet's page,
  and may even serve to divert or recall attention to "Gospel trees," which
  have more than poetical claim to that appellation.</p>

  <p>"<i>Who from the dark and doubtful love to run</i>" (Vol. v., p.

  which, as the book is before me, I will transcribe:</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <p><i>Son of the Conqueror; Walker Tyrrel</i> (Vol. v., p.
  512.).&mdash;No other son of William the Conqueror, except William Rufus,
  was slain by an arrow in the New Forest. A grandson, however, of the
  Conqueror, Richard, son of Robert Duke of Normandy, met with the same
  fate as Rufus, as stated by the cotemporary chronicler, Florentius
  Wigornensis. (Edition of the Historical Society, vol. ii. p. 45.)
  Immediately after describing the death of William Rufus, he says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Nam et antea ejusdem Willelmi junioris germanus, Ricardus, in eadem
  foresta multo ante perierat, et paulo ante <i>suus fratruelis</i>,
  Ricardus, comitis scilicet Normannorum Rotberti filius, dum et ipse in
  venatu fuisset, a suo milite sagitta percussus, interiit."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Probably Sir N. Wraxhall or his authority had read this statement
  hastily, and had construed <i>fratruelis</i> brother instead of
  <i>nephew</i>, which is the correct sense of the word.</p>

  <p>Your correspondent asks further for the authority for the death of
  William Rufus. Every historian of that day&mdash;Florentius Wigornensis
  and the Saxon chronicler among others&mdash;gives the received account of
  his death, except Suger, a Norman abbot, who says that Sir W. Tyrrel took
  a solemn oath to him that he was not the slayer of the king, but that the
  arrow came from an unknown hand.</p>

  <p>There can, I think, be little doubt but that Sir W. Tyrrel's was the
  hand that drew the bow; whether, however, he intended to kill the king or
  not, is a point which it is probable, after the time that has elapsed,
  will never be satisfactorily determined.</p>

  <p><i>Sir Gilbert Gerrard</i> (Vol. v., p. 511.).&mdash;I beg to refer
  <span class="sc">Mr. Spedding</span> to Erdeswick's <i>Staffordshire</i>,
  by Harwood (1820), p. 83., who states that Sir Gilbert Gerrard died in
  1592, and that he was buried in Ashley churchyard in that county, under a
  handsome monument. Probably the inscription on it will give the precise
  date, and some of your readers may be able to refer to it, and send the
  communication to "N. &amp; Q." His death must have occurred between
  January 8, 1592, 34 Elizabeth, the date of his will as given in Dugdale's
  <i>Baronage</i>, vol. ii. p. 417., and the following April; if Dugdale is
  right in saying that it was then proved. But on referring to the <i>Baga
  de Secretis</i>, the contents of which are so excellently calendared by
  Sir Francis Palgrave in the Appendices to his third, fourth, and fifth
  reports as deputy-keeper of the Public Records, it appears that Sir
  Gilbert was named in a commission of Oyer and Terminer, on March 22; that
  he signed a precept under it for the return of the grand jury, on April
  11; and that he signed another precept to the lieutenant of the Tower for
  bringing up Sir John Perrott before the justices, on <i>June 12</i>, all
  in 34 Elizabeth, 1592. (Fourth Report, Appendix II. pp. 282, 283.) It
  would seem, therefore, that Dugdale has erred in the date he assigns to
  the probate of Sir Gilbert's will. A search, however, at Doctors' Commons
  will solve the difficulty.</p>

  <p><i>Fides Carbonarii</i> (Vol. iv., pp. 233. 283.; Vol. v., p.

  Milner, but is at least three hundred years old. Cardinal Hosius commends
  it highly (<i>De auctor. sacræ Script.</i>: Opp. fol. 263.: Antverp.
  1556), and so does Staphylus likewise (<i>Apologia</i>, fol. 83.: Colon.
  1562). Bellarmin gives another version of the narrative, which he has
  taken from Petrus Barocius (<i>De arte bene moriendi</i>, lib. ii. cap.
  ix. pp. 200-203.: Antverp. 1620). Your correspondents should not have
  forgotten the concluding question and answer in what Crakenthorp has
  styled "The Colliar's Catechisme" (<i>Vigilius Dormitans</i>, p. 187.:
  Lond. 1631). The entire of the conversation may be represented thus:</p>

  <p>"I believe what the Church believes."</p>

  <p>"And what does the Church believe?"</p>

  <p>"And what do you both believe?"</p>

  <p>"The same thing."</p>

  <p><i>Meaning of Royd as an Addition to Yorkshire Names</i> (Vol. v., p.
  489.).&mdash;The glossary to Hulton's <i>Coucher Book of Whalley
  Abbey</i> at once gives it thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span class="sc">Roda</span>, an assart, or clearing. Rode land is
  used in this sense in modern German, in which the verb roden means to
  clear. The combination of the syllable rod, <i>rode</i>, or <i>royd</i>,
  with some other term, or with the name of an original settler, has, no
  doubt, given to particular localities such designations as Huntroyd,
  Ormerod, &amp;c., &amp;c."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>See also Lower <i>On Surnames</i> (3rd edit. i. 85.), and an elaborate
  note in Dr. Whitaker's <i>Whalley</i>, referred to in his account of
  Ormerod (3rd edit. p. 364.).</p>

  <p>In the sense which Dr. W. gives to <i>Rode</i>, or <i>Royd</i>, as "a
  participial substantive of the provincial verb <i>rid</i>, to clear or
  grub up," that word will be found singly, or in combination, near forests
  and chases from the Lancashire Pendle to the Devonshire Dartmoor. It
  occurs also in Rodmore, Rodleys, &amp;c., in the forest district of
  Gloucestershire over Severn; and Murray's <i>Handbook</i> may be referred
  to for Wernigerode, Elbingerode, &amp;c., in the Hartz forest of
  Germany.</p>

  <p>In Lancashire and Yorkshire the adjunct sometimes refers to the
  <i>early proprietor</i>, as in Monkroyd, Martinrode, &amp;c.; sometimes
  to the <i>trees ridded</i>, as in Oakenrode, Acroyd, Hollinrode, Holroyd,
  &amp;c.; sometimes to other characteristics. Instances of all kinds will
  be found in the <i>Whalley Coucher Book</i>, printed by the Chetham

  <p><i>Binnacle</i> (Vol. v., p. 499.).&mdash;This word, which signifies
  the case or covering of the compass, was until the last thirty years
  spelled and pronounced "bittacle," and is derived, I should imagine, from
  the French word <i>habitacle</i>, a little habitation, a hut, a covering.
  It is almost the only one of our nautical terms which can be traced to a
  French origin.</p>

  <p><i>Plague Stones</i> (Vol. v., p. 500.).&mdash;I have not observed
  that any of your correspondents have noticed the stones near the romantic
  village of Eyam, about four and a half miles E. N. E. of Tideswell in
  Derbyshire.</p>

  <p>It is well known that this village suffered most severely from the
  plague; and the inhabitants still revere the memory of their pastor Mr.
  Nompesson, who nobly refused to desert his flock in the hour of danger,
  and fell a sacrifice to his devotion. I became acquainted with these
  stones some years <!-- Page 572 --><span class="pagenum" title="044.png"
  ><a name="page572"></a>{572}</span>ago, when on tour through Derbyshire,
  and, if I remember rightly, they are about two and a half feet high, one
  foot and a half in diameter, with a hollow place on the top like a dish,
  in which we were told the money of the "plague village" people was placed
  for the food, &amp;c. that was brought to this boundary line by the
  people of the neighbourhood. The cavity in the stone was of course full
  of water.</p>

  <p><i>Ramasshed</i> (Vol. iii., p. 347.).&mdash;The Fr. <i>ramas</i> (as
  also <i>ramon</i>) is "<i>boughs</i> formed into a <i>besom</i> or
  broom," Fr. <i>rameau</i>, from the Lat. <i>ramus</i>. To <i>ramass</i>
  or <i>ramash</i> is "to put or sweep together, as with a broom." Thus,
  Hackluyt, in his Preface to the Reader, speaks of volumes "most untruly
  and unprofitablie <i>ramassed</i> or hurled to." To <i>ramassh</i> is
  also "to use a <i>ramas</i> or a construction of ram<i>asses</i>" (in the
  case of Syr R. Guyldford) as a vehicle for conveyance. The sleds first
  used for carrying travellers safely down steep hills were probably
  composed of bough-hurdles, afterwards transformed into barrows and other
  more convenient carriages.</p>

  <p><i>Derivation of Martinique</i> (Vol. v., pp. 11. 165.).&mdash;<span
  class="sc">Mr. Philip S. King</span>'s statement, that Martinique was
  discovered on St. Martin's day, is at variance with the account given by
  the historian of that island, who says that it was discovered on the 15th
  June, 1502, during Columbus's fourth voyage. The derivation of
  <i>Martinique</i> from <i>Martin</i> suggests itself so obviously, that,
  if the discovery had been made on the day (November 11) consecrated to
  that saint, it is not likely that the local historian would have gone out
  of his way to fix upon a Caribbean expression, <i>Martinina</i>, as the
  origin of the name.</p>

  <p><i>Sneezing</i> (Vol. v., pp. 364. 500.).&mdash;I have often seen, but

  when any one <!-- Page 573 --><span class="pagenum" title="045.png"><a

  great plague of Athens sneezing was an unfailing proof of returning
  convalescence. Your classical readers will remember the anecdote told in
  the <i>Anabasis</i> of Xenophon (c. ii. sect. i.-v.). I copy from
  Mitford, who has besides a note to the purpose:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"At daybreak the troops were assembled, and Chirosophus, Cleanor, and
  Xenophon successively addressed them. An accident, in itself even
  ridiculous, assisted not a little, through the importance attributed to
  it by Grecian superstition, to infuse encouragement. Xenophon was
  speaking of that favour from the gods which a righteous cause entitled
  them to hope for against a perjured enemy, when somebody <i>sneezed</i>.
  Immediately the general voice addressed ejaculations to protecting
  Jupiter, whose omen it was supposed to be. A sacrifice to the god was
  then proposed; a universal shout declared approbation; and the whole
  army, in one chorus, sang the Pæan."&mdash;<i>History of Greece</i>, vol.

  <p><i>Newtonian System</i> (Vol. v., p. 490.).&mdash;The author of the
  pamphlet entitled <i>The Theology and Philosophy of Cicero's Somnium
  Scipionis explained</i>, London, 1751, 8vo., was Bishop Horne. He wrote
  it before he had attained majority, and many attacks were made upon it.
  It is not included in the edition of his collected works in 6 vols. 8vo.
  1809. Bishop Warburton, who cordially disliked the Hutchinsonians, or, as
  he styled them, the English Cocceians, mentions this tract in his
  <i>Letters to Bishop Hurd</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There is one book, and that no large one, which I would recommend to
  your perusal; it is called <i>The Theology and Philosophy of Cicero's
  Somn. Scip. examined</i>. It is indeed the ne plus ultra of
  Hutchinsonianism. In this twelve-penny pamphlet Newton is proved an
  atheist and a blockhead. And what would you more?"&mdash;Warburton's
  <i>Letters to Hurd</i>, edit. 1808, 4to. p. 63.</p>

  <p>The anecdote as to Newton, Locke, and Lord Pembroke, p. 27., was first
  told by Whiston, whose character for accuracy does not stand high,
  particularly when Sir I. Newton, against whom he bore a grudge, is
  concerned.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Jas. Crossley.</span></p>

  <p><i>Newton, Cicero, and Gravitation</i> (Vol. v., p.
  344.).&mdash;Newton is celebrated for having proved that all bodies
  attract one another with a force varying inversely as the square of the
  distance. What resemblance has this to a statement, that all bodies
  gravitate to the centre of the world, or, as explained by Cicero, the
  earth? which at most only implies its rotundity. Perhaps S. E. B. was
  joking, like Hegel, when he said that Newton called 5/A<sup>2</sup>
  gravitation, and inferred that gravitation varied as 1/A<sup>2</sup>.
  Otherwise modern philosophers, as <i>e.g.</i> Kepler, would have supplied
  much nearer approximations to Newton's law.</p>

  <p><i>Rhymes on the Names of Places</i> (Vol. v., p. 404.).&mdash;I
  remember hearing the following verse in the neighbourhood of
  Nottingham:</p>

      <p class="hg3">"Eaton and Taton, and Bramcote o' th' hill,</p>

      <p>Ho fine Nottingham! Colwick and Snenton."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The villages whose names occur are all within a few miles of
  Nottingham.</p>

  <p>The following rhyme I have also heard:</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <p><i>Saint Wilfrid's Needle</i> (Vol. v., p. 510.), where, according to
  Burton, "they used to try maids whether they were honest," is not, as B.
  B. supposes, a stone, but a narrow passage in the crypt beneath the
  central tower of Ripon Minster. This crypt is of Saxon workmanship, and
  is probably either a part of the original church built by Saint Wilfrid,
  or "the new work," which, according to Leland&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>"Measure for Measure," Act I. Sc. 1.</i> (Vol. v., p.
  535.).&mdash;I should be sorry to cast a cloud over the
  <i>satisfactory</i> elucidation which A. E. B. flatters himself he has
  made of a passage in <i>Measure for Measure</i>, for, if not convincing,
  it is unquestionably ingenious. I am afraid, however, there is one fatal
  objection, of which, when pointed out, I <!-- Page 574 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="046.png"><a name="page574"></a>{574}</span>doubt
  not your correspondent will see the force. He says, "the demonstrative
  pronoun <i>that</i>, refers to <i>the commission</i> which the Duke holds
  in his hand;" but is this the language we in England use? Until the Duke
  presented the commission,&mdash;the act indicated by the words "there is
  our commission,"&mdash;there cannot indeed be much doubt that he held it
  in his hand; and while he did so, he would as certainly have said
  <i>this</i>, as I speak of <i>this</i> pen with which I write.</p>

  <p>Your correspondent challenges comment in assuming that his explanation
  was satisfactory enough to preclude all correction. At the same time I
  must confess I am altogether sceptical with regard to Mr. Halliwell's
  <i>verb</i>. As, however, he has excited our curiosity, he will doubtless
  not object to satisfy it. <span class="sc">Mr. Singer</span>'s suggestion
  seems to me worthy of consideration; but, after all, I feel that there is
  a degree of incoherency in the passage, and so unsatisfactory a connexion
  between the words "and let them work" and that which precedes, that I
  cannot help recurring to the idea that a line has been lost,&mdash;an
  accident of not very uncommon occurrence.</p>

  from George Cox's brilliant satire, <i>Black Gowns and Red Coats; or,
  Oxford in 1834</i>, respecting which some information was recently
  furnished by your correspondents S. F. C. (Vol. v., p. 297.) and C. W. B.
  (Vol. v., p. 332.) in reply. The work is perhaps sufficiently scarce to
  warrant the citation of the whole passage, which occurs at the
  commencement of Part V.:</p>

  volume entitled <i>Hymns and Anthems</i> (published by Chas. Fox, 1845),

  Fifty years ago he might be seen nightly dancing over bog and brake; but
  since the process of warping has been discovered, which has made valuable
  property of what was before a morass, nearly the whole of the commons
  between Gainsborough and the Humber have been brought into cultivation,

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>A late eminent scholar was in the habit of advising his friends, when
  in doubt which of two books to buy: "If one of them is a Dictionary,
  always buy the Dictionary:"&mdash;and the noble library which he
  bequeathed to the public shows that he himself always acted upon this
  principle. What he said of Dictionaries generally, will apply with
  particular force to the very admirable <i>Dictionary of Science,
  Literature, and Art; comprising the History, Description, and Scientific
  Principles of every Branch of Human Knowledge, with the Derivation and
  Definition of all the Terms in General Use</i>, edited by Professor
  Brande and Dr. Cauvin, with the assistance of many eminent literary and
  scientific gentlemen, of which the second edition is now before us. Our
  impression on opening it was, that <span class="sc">Notes &amp;
  Queries</span> would find its occupation gone: and, although it is
  obvious that such cannot be the case, we feel sure that if all Querists
  upon ordinary subjects would turn to this excellent compendium of general
  information before transmitting to us many such inquiries as we now
  receive, they would at once be put in possession of the information of
  which they are in search; and we should be spared a very considerable
  amount of labour. The object which the proprietors proposed to themselves
  in the one closely printed volume of which the <!-- Page 575 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="047.png"><a name="page575"></a>{575}</span>book
  consists, has been to supply the place of those large Encyclopædias and
  Dictionaries of modern times which are either too voluminous or too
  special for ready reference and general use; and to produce, in a form
  which should admit of its being carried about, a work which, without
  entering into long details of theories, &amp;c., should exhibit an
  <i>abstract of the principles of every branch of knowledge, and a
  definition and explanation of the various terms in Science, Literature,
  and Art</i>, which occur in reading or conversation, with that facility
  of reference and precision of statement which ought to be the
  distinguishing features of a useful Dictionary. Thanks to the knowledge
  and good judgment of the editors and their assistants, this object has
  been so successfully accomplished, that Brande's <i>Dictionary of
  Science, Literature, and Art</i>, may be pronounced as at once a valuable
  substitute for a small library, and an indispensable accompaniment and
  key to a large one.</p>

  <p>The new volume (the sixth), which has just been issued, of Messrs.
  Rivington's handsome edition of <i>The Works and Correspondence of the
  Right Honourable Edmund Burke</i>, is one of peculiar interest, inasmuch
  as in addition to his Tracts on the Laws against Popery in Ireland, and
  his Reports of the House of Commons on the affairs of the East India
  Company, and the Charges against Warren Hastings, it contains his Hints
  for an Essay on the Drama, and the Essay towards an Abridgment of the
  English History in Three Books.</p>
